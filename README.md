Quiz generator (made by me, GPT 3.5 and Django web framework)

Generate a quiz based on form input values (topic, time limit, GPT temperature, amounts of questions and answers).
It's GPT 3.5 (text-davinci-003) so it bases on the training set which is already outdated (up to Jun 2021).
If it won't know much about the topic it will make it up, thus I do not guarantee that the quizzes are in line with reality.

You can find it hosted at https://quizgenerator.pythonanywhere.com/
The git version does not contain personal keys needed to run the website locally.
